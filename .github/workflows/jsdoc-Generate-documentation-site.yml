# This is a workflow that uses jsdoc library to generate a static site from the comments on the library code.
#
# Once the static site is generated using the command 'npm run build-jsdoc' from the 'mathtype-html-integration-devkit'
# package, it runs some validations to the generated files at 'packages/mathtype-html-integration-devkit/out/' folder.
#
# Validation consists on:
#  - The main index.html file is not empty.
#  - There are no broken links on the HTML files.
#  - There are no broken images on the HTML files.
#
# If validation passes the static site is published as an artifact.
