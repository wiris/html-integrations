# Jobs:
# - "generate-docs"
#
#   This is job uses jsdoc library to generate a static site from the comments on the library code.
#
#   Once the static site is generated using the command 'yarn run build-jsdoc' from the 'mathtype-html-integration-devkit'
#   package, it runs some validations to the generated files at 'packages/devkit/out/' folder.
#
#   Validation consists on:
#    - The main index.html file is not empty.
#    - There are no broken links on the HTML files.
#
#   If validation passes the static site is published as an artifact called 'mathtype-html-integration-devkit-docs.zip'.
