# TinyMCE sources

The two TinyMCE plugins share the same source code (`editor_plugin.src.js` file). In order to be able to compile both files in parallel and without collisions, the following file schema is used:

- `packages/mathtype-tinymce/editor_plugin.src.js`
- `packages/mathtype-tinymce4/editor_plugin.src.js -> ../mathtype-tinymce/editor_plugin.src.js`
- `packages/mathtype-tinymce5/editor_plugin.src.js -> ../mathtype-tinymce/editor_plugin.src.js`

Where the arrow (`->`) indicates that the left file is a symbolic link ("symlink") pointing to the right file.

Upon calling the compile script (see `scripts/services/compile.js`), a check is done to see whether the file to make replacements in (in this case, `editor_plugin.src.js`) is a symlink or not. If it is, before doing the whole compile process, the original source file (in this case, the one in `packages/mathtype-tinymce`) is *copied* over to the folder where the symlink is, and the replacement is done to the copied file, so as not to modify the source file that both symlinks point to. Finally, once the compilation is done and the result is already in the `output` folder, the symlink is recreated in order to return to the initial state.
